Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) are
useful building blocks in a variety of applications, including
biomedical, data storage read channels, and optical receivers,
because they serve as the interface between important world
analog signals and, as a result, digital signal processors. In
this study, an attempt is made to design a power efficient 4-bit
Flash Analog to Digital Converter [ADC] for biomedical
applications. Furthermore, this work examines the sample and
hold circuit, comparator, and encoder in a 4-bit Flash Analog
to Digital Converter (ADC) to achieve a power efficient ADC.
In this work, the R-2R ladder is replaced with a sample and
hold circuit to lower power consumption, the traditional
comparator is replaced with a simple comparator, and the
priority encoder is used as an alternative to the traditional
encoder. It is implemented utilizing 0.18Î¼m CMOS technology.
In general, CADENCE VIRTUOSO tools are used to develop
schematics and run simulations. The simulation results
include a 1.8V analog input range with a frequency of
33.20MHz.
